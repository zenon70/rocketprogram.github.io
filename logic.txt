# IN-PROGRESS
-------------






# HARD CRASH
------------
known & intended hyperbolic "safe crash" needs proper exit
  when iterations > 9999 to solve, NaN occurs
  need proper exit / catch
crash at center of planet
8 million timestep + thrust straight up...


# GUI ISSUES
------------
gui hud numbers wrapping, and going outside of tinted background

hud overlaps on smartphone in widescreen if not fullscreened

firefox mobile 96.0.0-beta.5 scrolling to hide address bar
  causes screen to resize wrong





# PHYSICS
---------

401 surface and graphics are WAY off
  more than just the dips in polygons
  is it really oblate? landing on 401 makes me think no.
not appearing on surface
  rotate earth mesh so rocket is at peak point?
  collision with surface graphics, with accurate gps
  surface graphics and gps ARE accurate??, if using
  1024 segments... so it just depends on segment
  heights.?? not true for 401!!
terrain: bump/relief map w/collision detection
  aerodynamics and negative altitude loss of momentum will need to be revised

rocket goes down when low thrust on surface

ecliptic lan parameter is off by almost precisely 90 deg, not sure why
  (ecliptic notes below)

not rotating with surface while landed
  rotate with parent
  attach independent child object at location of landing.
  set with rotation of rocket. copy that rotation.
  if the rocket is rotated manually then rotate the clone.

spacecraft rotation from warp is wrong.. requires complicated formula.

air density on other planets
  and re-entry heat

add major moons, asteroids, comets for sure, all ~200 moons hopefully

navball prograde, radial, normal markers for eci & ecef
  target anti-target marker
  maneuver marker



# CONTROLS & GUI
----------------
add impulse power for spin controls

make menu look nice, nicer user interface (menus, info, more options)
  show/hide axes (planets, etc)
  show/hide individual orbit lines
  gui buttons sizes mobile (normal) vs desktop etc
  make menu larger for big screens, ok for smaller screens?

have deltaV stats

show "maxq" on screen when passed

add orbitcontrols option for large bodies, with min zoom, compatible with tilt

add real-time sync (already coded in an old version)



# 3D VISUALS
------------
first person camera

camera should start UP, wherever you start

restore camera zoom level on view change?

visual clouds on a few planets: 299, 399, maybe 499, a few moons

sky color during daytime or in thick atmosphere, from camera location

shadows, especially for planet 6 rings
    use DirectionalLight or SpotLight near planet

constellation map

adjustable scale



# CODE REFACTORING
------------------
use an actual convention for orbital parameter variable names
  like IAU or mpcorb or NASA or UCS.. whichever i want to import from most

improve body array naming system i.e. earth = 3 .name = 399,  planet4 = 4...

use a json object file for solar system orbit data



# SAVE / LOAD
-------------
select launch location

assorted rocket models, using stats

multiple satellites

track any asteroid or object

save/load state
    landing boosters
    docking & transfer of resources (fuel, etc)
  multiplayer
    send/receive orbit info
    login

# EFFICIENCY
------------

livestream crashes on 2gb phone, need super low-res startup, set hi-res maps
  running 9 planets and 3 moons and a sun and rocket.. is slow.. especially
  with orbit lines... so efficiency needs to be improved.
why slow?
- loading all planets & moons with textures at the same time
- polygons, gltf models
- high res textures
- two scenes
- orbit lines
    recalculating some elements (i, lan, w) and redrawing on every frame
    ellipse with 500 points
- rockets are part of n-body physics
- gps velocity unnecessary?
- general efficiency can probably be drastically improved
- orbMech settings for transcendental equation
initialization-only
- loading the whole threejs instead of just modules
    but i prefer console use (n/a with modules)
- processing space data (instead of it being pre-processed)

# SKYBOX
--------
using CubeTextureLoader, to get z-up orientation:

starting with a nasa star map in hdri (sphere) format where: aries is in the center, the northvstar is on top, and orion is on the left:

upload to:
https://matheowis.github.io/HDRI-to-CubeMap/
and output zip of 6 single, non-rotated files.
the hdri break tool outputs files as follows:

NASA HDRI IMAGE          HDRI     Z-UP   slot rot.
left [orion]          -> nx.png   +y     3    180
bottom (below center) -> ny.png   -z     6    right
sides                 -> nz.png   -x     1    left
right                 -> px.png   -y     4    none
top (above center)    -> py.png   +z     5    right
center                -> pz.png   +x     2    right


extended reference:
the THREE.js CubeTextureLoader slot order is as follows:

slot1 = -x
slot2 = +x
slot3 = +y (above +z)
slot4 = -y (below +z)
slot5 = +z
slot6 = -z
