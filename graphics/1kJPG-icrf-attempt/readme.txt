these are from an 8k tif from nasa, broken up into 1k pieces.

they were originally in cgi orientation, but an attempt has been made to re-orient them to z-up (space convention) orientation.

the 8k tif (as opposed to the 16k tif) is brighter. so it's not just a lower resolution, but it's also brighter.

some rotations have been made by a smartphone app in this conversion attempt. in my experience, sometimes a rotation done on a smartphone app changes the rotation for that app, but not for other software. this is because there can be 2 different parameters set in an image file regarding rotation, and they can conflict, giving different renderings in different programs.
