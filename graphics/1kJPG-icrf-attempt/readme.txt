these are from an 8k tif from nasa, broken up into 1k pieces.

they were originally in cgi orientation, but an attempt has been made to re-orient them to z-up (space convention) orientation.

the 8k tif (as opposed to the 16k tif) is brighter. so it's not just a lower resolution, but it's also brighter.
