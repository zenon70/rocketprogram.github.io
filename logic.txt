IN-PROGRESS:







ISSUES:

crash at center of planet
    couldn't launch from 401, went down instead
        perhaps due to low thrust

KNOWN & INTENDED HYPERBOLIC "SAFE CRASH"
    when iterations > 9999 to solve, forgetaboutit...
    need safe failout

bounce off atmosphere at high warp



livestream crashes, need super low-res startup, select hq maps

earth's inclination.. to sun axes (equator) or ecliptic?



MAJOR AWKWARDITIES:

not appearing on surface
    rotate earth mesh so rocket is at peak point?
    collision with surface graphics, with accurate gps
    surface graphics and gps ARE accurate, if using
    1024 segments... so it just depends on segment
    heights.

rotate with surface while landed
  rotate with parent
  attach independent child object at location of landing.
  set with rotation of rocket. copy that rotation.
  if the rocket is rotated manually then rotate the clone.



MINOR AWKWARDNESSESS:

camera should start UP

restore camera zoom level on view change?

make menu look nice, nicer user interface (menus, info, more options)
  show/hide axes (planets, etc)
  show/hide individual orbit lines
  gui buttons sizes mobile (normal) vs desktop etc

make menu larger for big screens, ok for smaller screens?



COOL FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

brighten/dim ambient light

select launch location

constellation map

air density on other planets
  re-entry heat

terrain: bump/relief map w/collision detection
  
GRAPHICS
  cloud layer
  sky color during daytime or in thick atmosphere, from camera location
  shadows, especially for planet 6 rings
    use DirectionalLight or SpotLight near planet

loading screen
ascii text "rocket" fades from screen on startup
"maxq" appears on screen when passed

first person camera

fuel, weight, thrust, deltaV ratios

major moons, asteroids, comets for sure, all ~200 moons hopefully

assorted rocket models, using stats
multiple satellites
track any asteroid or object

adjustable scale



EFFICIENCY:

why the slowness:

- loading all planets & moons with textures at the same time

- polygons, gtlf models

- high res textures

- two scenes
  
  orbit lines
    recalculating kepler and redrawing on every frame
    ellipse with 500 points

  processing space data (instead of it being pre-processed)
  
  loading the whole threejs instead of just modules?
    it may not make a difference
    i prefer console use (n/a in modules)

  rockets are part of n-body physics

  gps velocity unnecessary

  general efficiency can probably be drastically improved






USER INTERFACE

  navball prograde, radial, normal markers for eci & ecef
    target anti-target marker
    maneuver marker

  orbit line
    draw pure hyperbolic line (vs ellipse)
    draw nbody trajectory
    apo/peri/incl markers on orbit line
    make truAnom as starting point for ellipse
      so that the rocket always appears on the line?
      but then peri/apo points are not shown

  orbitcontrols option for large bodies, with min zoom, *angle*
    solve zoom difficulty issue
    solve pole angle issue

  real-time sync (already coded in an old version)


MULTI
  multiple satellites, "inFlight" variable
  save/load state
    landing boosters
    docking & transfer of resources (fuel, etc)
  multiplayer
    send/receive orbit info
    login

ALTITUDE

- gps tells you MSL: Mean Sea Level at specific location. it's accurate, even with oblate spheroids, but it does NOT tell you the height of actual physical surface features, like mountains and valleys (which are not implemented)...
- Ap shows MSL of equatorial.




// shadow setup
if (focus === 0) {
// setup a DirectionalLight
// positioned outside if the furthest child
// in the direction of the sun, facing back

















orbital speed at equator when surface speed is zero
va = 0.0000729211585454431
vt = va * distance

SKYBOX

using CubeTextureLoader, to get z-up orientation:

starting with a nasa star map in hdri (sphere) format where: aries is in the center, the northvstar is on top, and orion is on the left:

upload to:
https://matheowis.github.io/HDRI-to-CubeMap/
and output zip of 6 single, non-rotated files.
the hdri break tool outputs files as follows:

NASA HDRI IMAGE          HDRI     Z-UP   slot rot.
left [orion]          -> nx.png   +y     3    180
bottom (below center) -> ny.png   -z     6    right
sides                 -> nz.png   -x     1    left
right                 -> px.png   -y     4    none
top (above center)    -> py.png   +z     5    right
center                -> pz.png   +x     2    right


extended reference:
the THREE.js CubeTextureLoader slot order is as follows:

slot1 = -x
slot2 = +x
slot3 = +y (above +z)
slot4 = -y (below +z)
slot5 = +z
slot6 = -z


notes on rocket models:

nice model, not centered, cheesy windows:

nice model, basically centered, wrong roll
